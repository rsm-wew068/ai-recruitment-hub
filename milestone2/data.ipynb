    "- Every bullet point should feel like it came from real work. No generic phrases like “collaborated with the team” or “improved performance by 25%” unless they are grounded in a specific technology, product, or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use real tools, libraries, APIs, and tech stacks in specific combinations. Example: “integrated Firebase authentication with a React Native frontend,” not just “built login system.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vary sentence structure across bullets. Not every line needs to follow the “Action → Tool → Result” template. Mix in bullets like:\n",
    "  - Maintained legacy JavaScript dashboard and resolved data sync issues with MongoDB\n",
    "  - Created technical documentation for deployment scripts using Jenkins and Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "- Company and project names should sound plausible. Avoid placeholders like “ABC Corp” or “Startup Inc.” Instead, use names like:\n",
    "  - “HealthNet AI” (for healthcare)\n",
    "  - “VantaLabs” (for a cloud startup)\n",
    "  - “OpenSensor Project” (for OSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If including percentages or metrics, keep them realistic and inconsistent — real resumes don't all use 30%, 40%, 50%. Sometimes just say “significantly improved,” or “reduced load times.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include *at least one line* that suggests a real human wrote this: mention a hackathon, an open-source repo, a tech blog, or mentoring another dev.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leave room for imperfection. Not every section has to be perfectly symmetric. A real resume has slightly uneven section lengths, imperfect alignment, and honest variability.\n",

    "## Resume Generation Using GenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we use a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse, professional-quality resumes tailored to simulated candidate profiles. The resume generation pipeline is designed to reflect real-world variation in tone, format, and content structure seen across applicants in a recruiting workflow. To show the tool's practicality, it is important to generate a very diverse set of resumes even if it is not directly aligned with the job description. This can capture the \"real world\" essence of job applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To prompt the LLM, we dynamically construct a description of a candidate based on:\n",
    "- **Seniority level** (e.g., New-Graduate, Senior, Staff)\n",
    "- **Technical specialization** (e.g., Backend, Cloud, AI/ML)\n",
    "- **Years of experience**\n",
    "- **Education level**\n",
    "- **A hand-crafted highlight** (mapped from specialization and seniority)\n",
    "\n",
    "This description is passed into a templated prompt that randomly varies:\n",
    "- Resume **style** (e.g., project-focused, minimalistic, startup-style)\n",
    "- Resume **tone** (e.g., corporate, technical, dynamic)\n",
    "- Section **ordering** (e.g., Education first, Skills first, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These stylistic variations are designed to reflect the wide variability in candidate resume formats seen in real hiring scenarios. Moreover, it is important that the LLM can read through different structures and extract the correct features when generating candidate profiles later down in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop over N candidate profiles**, randomly assigning seniority, specialization, years of experience, and educational background.\n",
    "2. Construct a descriptive input string from these values.\n",
    "3. Use `generate_resume(description)` to invoke the LLM and return a Markdown-formatted resume.\n",
    "4. Extract key fields like **email** and **name** from the resume text using regex and heuristics.\n",
    "5. Assign a `candidate_id` and save the resume as a uniquely named `.pdf`.\n",
    "6. Construct a corresponding application record, linking the resume to a `job_id`, a generated `application_date`, and an `application source`.\n",
    "7. Store each application in a structured list for later export.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also attempt to simulate \"application\" level data commonly seen in systems such as Workday. This is to collect more data on candidates that the recruitment analytics pipeline will require to create better insights. An LLM is not used to generate this data, just a mere random selection of possible categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markdown-to-PDF resumes** for each simulated candidate\n",
    "- A list of structured application records saved to `applications.csv`\n",
    "- Contextual metadata (e.g., candidate ID, resume file name, and job linkage)\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation pipeline enables the creation of a synthetic but realistic candidate funnel suitable for downstream GenAI evaluation, profile scoring, and job matching tasks.\n"

    "## Team Member Resume Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section programmatically generates synthetic team member resumes to simulate realistic internal employee profiles. These profiles are used in downstream evaluation workflows for contextual candidate scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- Populate the internal `employees` context pool for comparison against job applicants\n",
    "- Generate Markdown-based resumes and convert them to PDF using realistic profile descriptions\n",
    "- Provide structured input for LLM analysis (e.g., team summaries, team fit scoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `create_team_member()` generates 10 team member profiles with randomized:\n",
    "   - Seniority level and years of experience\n",
    "   - Education level\n",
    "   - Core cloud infrastructure skills and projects\n",
    "   - A secondary technical specialization and its associated skills\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `describe_team_member(profile)` converts each structured profile into a rich, natural-language resume summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `generate_resume(description)` prompts an LLM to turn the profile description into a full Markdown resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `save_markdown_as_pdf()` renders each Markdown resume into a styled PDF and saves it to the `data/resumes_team/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. All resumes are uniquely named using UUID-based employee IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 PDF resumes saved to `data/resumes_team/`\n",
    "- Each file is used to simulate current team members in candidate evaluation pipelines\n"
