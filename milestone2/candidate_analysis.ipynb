       "Okay, I've analyzed the data regarding candidate experience (measured in years) and their average score based on the tool's output.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Findings:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The correlation coefficient between \"Years of Experience\" and \"avg_score\" is 0.8653. This is a significant positive correlation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Explanation of the Findings:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Correlation Coefficient:** The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A value close to +1 indicates a strong positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. A value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, meaning as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A value close to 0 indicates a weak or no linear correlation.\n",
       "*   **Positive Correlation (0.8653):** In this case, the 0.8653 value suggests a strong positive linear relationship between a candidate's years of experience and their average score. This means that, generally, candidates with more years of experience tend to have higher average scores in the assessment or evaluation process.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Detailed Opinions and Implications:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Experience Matters (But Isn't Everything):** The strong positive correlation indicates that experience is a significant predictor of a candidate's performance (as measured by the \"avg\\_score\"). This is not surprising, as experienced individuals are likely to have developed valuable skills, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities relevant to the role. However, the correlation isn't perfect (it's not 1.0). This means other factors *also* contribute to the average score, such as innate aptitude, learning agility, specific domain knowledge not necessarily tied to overall experience, cultural fit, and even luck during the evaluation process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Potential Use in Screening/Selection:** This correlation could be used to inform the initial screening or filtering of candidates.  For instance, if a high average score is crucial for a particular role, prioritizing candidates with a certain minimum level of experience might be a valid strategy. *However, I strongly advise against solely relying on experience*.  It's important to avoid unintentionally discriminating against less experienced but potentially highly capable individuals. Consider the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Define \"Experience\" Clearly:**  What type of experience is most relevant?  General work experience might not be as valuable as experience specifically in the relevant industry or with a particular technology.\n",
       "    *   **Look Beyond Years:**  Focus on demonstrable skills and accomplishments. A less experienced candidate who has demonstrably delivered significant results in a related area could be a better fit than a more experienced candidate with a less impressive track record.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Further Investigation Needed:** While the correlation is strong, I would recommend digging deeper to understand *why* this correlation exists. Are there specific types of experience that are more strongly correlated with success? Are there certain assessment components where experience plays a more significant role? Analyzing these nuances could help refine the hiring process further.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Consider the \"avg_score\" Metric:** It's important to understand how the \"avg\\_score\" is calculated.  Is it based on standardized assessments, interviews, portfolio reviews, or a combination of factors?  The nature of the score will influence how much weight should be given to experience. For example, if the average score is heavily weighted towards a technical assessment, experience might be a very reliable predictor. If it's more subjective, the relationship might be less reliable.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Bias Mitigation:** Be aware of potential biases related to experience. For example, if the company culture historically favors a specific demographic, the \"years of experience\" metric might inadvertently perpetuate that bias. Ensure that the evaluation process is fair and equitable for all candidates, regardless of their background or years of experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Use the correlation as a guide, not a rigid rule.\n",
       "*   Investigate the reasons behind the correlation.\n",
       "*   Thoroughly define the relevant types of experience.\n",
       "*   Prioritize skills and demonstrable achievements.\n",
       "*   Continuously evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of the hiring process.\n",
       "*   Look at other variables that contribute to higher scores.\n"

    "\n",
    "This section investigates the relationship between a candidate's years of experience and their evaluated fit for a role, as measured by the average of LLM-generated scores (LLama and Gemini). The goal is to explore whether more experience consistently correlates with higher suitability ratings, or if other factors are more predictive of candidate quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "- We compute the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between `Years of Experience` and `Average Score` using Pandas' `.corr()` method.\n",
    "- This gives a value between -1 and 1, where:\n",
    "  - `1` indicates a perfect positive correlation\n",
    "  - `0` means no correlation\n",
    "  - `-1` indicates a perfect negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM-Augmented Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance explainability, the notebook uses **Google's Gemini model** in a tool-calling setup. The LLM:\n",
    "- Invokes a function to compute the correlation\n",
    "- Then provides a narrative explanation of the result, offering insights such as:\n",
    "  - Whether experience is a strong predictor of score\n",
    "  - Possible reasons for weak or inverse relationships (e.g., skill relevance, recency, resume strength)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for **both statistical precision and narrative interpretation**, enabling a more human-readable understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings help inform:\n",
    "- Whether to weigh experience more heavily during candidate evaluation\n",
    "- Whether the scoring logic used by the LLMs might be favoring other traits (e.g., skill diversity, project work)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point of this section is generate basic insights that recruiters can use based off of the applications they have collected and the insights GenAI has generated so far. At large firms, we can expect these insights can be easily generated amongst people analytics or recruitment analyst teams. Moreover, with the domain expertise each analyst has, it can create statistical insights that match their needs. Nevertheless, in the case that recruitment teams do not have data scientists/analysts that are dedicated for recruitment, they can utilize this AI tool powered by a statistical tool to generate insights. We also allow the LLM to generate explanatory insights for teams to intake. These explanations are tied directly to recruitment use cases, so not only will be generating explanations of the stats, we see appropriate interpretations of the data."

On the one hand, he has a strong educational background, with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Stanford University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from MIT, demonstrating a solid foundation in computer science principles. Additionally, his experience as a Staff Software Engineer at CyberSecure Inc. and Senior Software Engineer at SecureNet LLC showcases his ability to work on complex projects, lead development teams, and mentor junior engineers. His technical skills, including proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, as well as experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, are also notable. However, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that Tony's experience is heavily focused on security, with less emphasis on cloud infrastructure, which is the primary requirement for the position. While he has some experience with cloud platforms, his skills in this area are not as deep or broad as those of other candidates. Furthermore, his projects and achievements, such as the Threat Modeling Toolkit and Security Awareness Training, although impressive in their own right, do not directly align with the cloud infrastructure expertise required for the role. Overall, while Tony is a strong candidate in many respects, his lack of direct experience in cloud infrastructure and his limited exposure to relevant technologies, such as containerization and infrastructure as code, make him a less ideal fit for the Senior Software Engineer position, warranting a score of 6 out of 10.\", \"Gemini Summary\": \"Tony Graves presents a mixed bag for a Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer role. While he boasts 9 years of experience and impressive security credentials, including threat modeling and SIEM development, his expertise heavily skews towards security rather than core cloud infrastructure.

    "## Visualization and Chart Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides visual insight into candidate evaluation data by generating charts that explore relationships between key variables such as years of experience, average score, education level, and application source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize the candidate level data through visualizations\n",
    "- Highlight patterns that can be uncovered by data visualizations\n",
    "- Allow charts to be generated automatically by GenAI with tool calling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `altair`, AI can generate charts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Histogram of Average Scores**: Visualizes how candidates are distributed based on their combined LLama and Gemini evaluation.\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot: Experience vs. Score**: Helps identify whether there’s a visible linear or nonlinear relationship between experience and perceived fit.\n",
    "- **Bar Charts by Education Level or Source**: Shows how different candidate segments perform on average or how they're represented in the applicant pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations serve as a bridge between raw data and human intuition, allowing hiring managers or analysts to grasp broader trends at a glance. The choice to use altair is to utilize the `JavaScript` integrations to allow charts to be interactable via tooltips and adjustable charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the charts being generated are \"appropriate\" we expose the LLM to the data that has been generated before. So by passing the data types, summaries, and few rows of the data, Gemini will use its own judgment to choose which variables and which chart type it will create. It is still susceptible to poor variable choices that lead to bad charts. But to prevent that, it is necessary to have many features it can choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to create actual insights, we need to expose Gemini to as much data as possible. In an API integration of Gemini, it does not have access to computer vision. Hence, it must be exposed to charts directly from the data itself through string formatting or through HTML version of the chart. But as the complexity of the chart can scale with more features or data, it is best to expose it to summary statistics via the `describe()` function. Moreover, we provide it with a sample of the data to provide the LLM with a Stochastic view of the data. This will be the best when there is a large dataset; it assumes that a small sample will be representative of the general population, so even a small subset will be enough to generate insights upon. We also do prompt the LLM to be very detailed in the insights it creates. Allowing it to explore different perspectives will create for richer information amongst recruitment teams, hopefully leading to more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "These charts support:\n",
    "- Stakeholder reporting\n",
    "- Bias detection (e.g., whether certain education levels are consistently scored lower)\n",
    "- Informing adjustments to evaluation criteria or LLM prompting strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this section is to again implement tool calling by LLMs to create data insights for recruitment. As stated before, the point of these tools is to generate data science insights for recruitment teams that do not have time and resources to implement data science strategies for recruitment. Generally, speaking we expect data scientists to gain an understanding of the data before creating insights. This may require a couple of hours to couple of days (depending on the size of the data). However, by allowing LLMs to understand the data by passing it through its chat interface, it should have a good understanding of the data at a faster rate than one data analyst that has been newly introduced to a dataset. This not only will save time, it allows smaller firms to implement recruitment data analyst strategies that managers can use to make smarter hiring decisions. Moreover, similar to the statistical analysis that was implemented to before, we will also allow the LLM to generate insights of the chart it created. Although it is not necessarily hard to interpret 2D charts, we can allow LLMs to catch nuances and unique insights that a novice or tunnel visioned data analyst may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between the first and second implementation of data analytics tools is the amount of freedom Gemini is allowed to have when allowing it to choose the chart type and variables it uses. However, issue is that if the LLM choose \"bad\" variables or chart types, it is hard to control without explicit prompting. For example, the LLM may choose to plot a histogram of \"Skills\" that were listed on a resume. What happens to be generated is a very messy graph that does not produce any insights. Although it is possible to prevent these types of mistakes, it is very much dependent on the prompting that Gemini receives. But in order to prevent a narrow pipeline of chart generation, we keep the prompt very loose. But by providing it as much context as possible, we can hope that the LLM will be smart in its choices."
